# we have seen Microsoft Excel crashing after crunching huge data. vlookup is one such scenario. In this notebook, we can see how python can efficiently do the same task in Milliseconds
# A scenario which i usually observe in my work is Excel takes 1.5-2 hours to vlookup a 108 column and a million-row file in a 32 thread CPU Citrix environment. but for the same job in python takes 18 seconds in a normal PC.
