This is a list of 10,000 women's shoes and their product information provided by Datafiniti's Product Database.

What You Can Do with This Data
You can use this data to determine brand markups, pricing strategies, and trends for luxury shoes. E.g.:

What is the average price of each distinct brand listed?
Which brands have the highest prices?
Which ones have the widest distribution of prices?
Is there a typical price distribution (e.g., normal) across brands or within specific brands?
Further processing data would also let you:

Correlate specific product features with changes in price.
You can cross-reference this data with a sample of our Men's Shoe Prices to see if there are any differences between women's brands and men's brands.
